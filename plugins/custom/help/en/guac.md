# Guac
This command lets you make judgments about other people. Do they guac it? Do they really?

`guac` - Shows if you are awesome. You need to have a value of "yes" or "I guac it" here to be awesome. A value of: "I got to guac it, guac it" means you and only you, wear sunglasses at night.
`guac/set <mystery text>` - Sets your level of awesome. No, we're not going to tell you what to type. If you are awesome, then you will _know_.

Characters with the "view_bgs" permission can view, and judge, your level of awesome by using `guac <name>`.
