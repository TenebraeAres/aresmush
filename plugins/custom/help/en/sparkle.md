# Sparkle
This command lets you record your character's level of sparkle.  Your personal sparkle level is only visible to yourself and staff, and may be changed at any time.

`sparkle` - Show your sparkle level. It doesn't allow you to see someone else's.
`sparkle/set <number>` - Sets your level of sparkle. The maximum is 9999, which is the sparkle level of Sandy. 
`sparkle <character>` - Views a character's sparkle level!

Characters with the "view_bgs" permission can view sparkle level using `sparkle <name>`.
